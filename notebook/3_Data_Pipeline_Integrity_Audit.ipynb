    "## Part A — Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 1. Audit Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this audit is to assess whether the current **data pipeline**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reliably transforms raw animal observation data into **clean, analysis-ready datasets**  \n",
    "- Scales with future data volume and feature growth  \n",
    "- Provides sufficient **traceability, governance and robustness** to feed downstream ML models and applications (e.g. Streamlit app, notebooks, reports)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧩 2. Headline Assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "The pipeline, as currently implemented, provides a **solid operational baseline**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Separation between `data/raw`, `data/cleaned` and `results/` is clear and well structured  \n",
    "- Cleaning steps are **deterministic** and reproducible  \n",
    "- Output datasets are **fit for purpose** for the current ML scope  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, to reach **enterprise-grade maturity**, three structural gaps must be addressed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Lack of formal schema & validation layer**  \n",
    "   - No explicit contract for column names, types, ranges, or allowed values  \n",
    "   - Increases risk of *silent data drift* and undetected upstream changes  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Limited observability & governance**  \n",
    "   - No standardized metadata logging (run timestamps, source files, row counts, failure reasons)  \n",
    "   - Harder to reconstruct historical runs or explain model behaviour to stakeholders  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Partial coupling between business logic and IO layer**  \n",
    "   - Reading, cleaning and business rules are sometimes mixed together  \n",
    "   - Raises maintenance cost and complicates future refactors or reuse\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⭐ 3. Key Strengths\n",
    "\n",
    "- Clear directory structure and consistent use of `Path` / relative paths  \n",
    "- Logical cleaning functions that can be reused across flows  \n",
    "- Explicit export of cleaned datasets for both **EDA** and **ML**  \n",
    "- Overall, a pipeline that is **already usable in production-like contexts** at small scale  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚠️ 4. Key Risks\n",
    "\n",
    "- Silent schema changes may not trigger alerts  \n",
    "- No central place to audit which raw files contributed to a given cleaned dataset  \n",
    "- Debugging issues (e.g. strange model outputs) is slower without a formal audit trail  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧭 5. Top 5 Strategic Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Introduce a schema validation layer** (e.g. Great Expectations, pandera, Pydantic models) before any transformation.  \n",
    "2. **Centralize logging & metadata** for each pipeline run (source file, row counts, null rates, failures).  \n",
    "3. **Separate IO, cleaning and business logic** into clearly defined modules and functions.  \n",
    "4. **Standardize naming conventions** for columns, datasets, and folders to support cross-team work.  \n",
    "5. **Define a simple data pipeline maturity model** and target a higher level within 3–6 months.\n",

    "### 1. Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The audit followed a **three-step consulting-style methodology**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Discovery & Mapping**  \n",
    "   - Reviewed project structure (`data/`, `results/`, `utils/`, `scripts/`)  \n",
    "   - Identified key entry points (e.g. cleaning scripts, loader utilities)  \n",
    "   - Mapped the current end-to-end flow from raw files to ML-ready tables  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Technical Deep-Dive**  \n",
    "   - Analysed loading, cleaning and transformation code  \n",
    "   - Traced how datasets move across **EDA**, **ML scripts**, and **applications**  \n",
    "   - Assessed robustness, modularity, and readability\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Risk & Value Assessment**  \n",
    "   - Scored maturity across key dimensions  \n",
    "   - Identified failure modes, edge cases, and operational risks  \n",
    "   - Prioritized recommendations based on impact vs effort  \n",

    "\n",
    "### 1. Ingestion & Input Management\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we looked at**\n",
    "\n",
    "- How raw CSVs are loaded (e.g. `pd.read_csv`, delimiter settings, encoding)  \n",
    "- Where raw data lives (`data/raw/`) and how files are discovered (hard-coded vs dynamic)  \n",
    "- How new sources or files would be integrated into the pipeline  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Findings**\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ Raw data is clearly separated in a dedicated `data/raw/` directory.  \n",
    "- ✅ Loading logic is centralized (rather than duplicated across multiple scripts).  \n",
    "- ⚠️ File discovery appears to be **explicit** (specific filenames) rather than pattern-based when scaling to multiple sources.  \n",
    "- ⚠️ No explicit **input contract** (what constitutes a valid file: mandatory columns, minimal row count, encoding expectations).  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Risk**\n",
    "\n",
    "If upstream teams modify file name patterns or encodings, the pipeline may **fail silently** or not pick up new data without clear errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommendation**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Introduce a small `ingestion_config` mapping that documents **which files and schemas** are expected.  \n",
    "- Validate presence and basic characteristics of each raw file before entering the cleaning stage.  \n",
    "- Optionally, define a simple “data intake checklist” notebook or script as a pre‑step.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Schema, Types & Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we looked at**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Column presence, naming conventions, type conversions and range checks  \n",
    "- Handling of unexpected values (e.g. new species, out‑of‑range weights, malformed dates)  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Findings**\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ Columns are cleaned and standardized in a consistent way in the cleaning logic.  \n",
    "- ✅ Date and categorical columns are normalised, improving downstream usage.  \n",
    "- ⚠️ No **explicit schema definition** (e.g. Pydantic, pandera, Great Expectations) defining:  \n",
    "  - column names and types  \n",
    "  - accepted ranges (e.g. weight > 0, height > 0)  \n",
    "  - sets of allowed categories (e.g. known species)  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Risk**\n",
    "\n",
    "Without an explicit schema:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data drift (new columns, renamed columns, type changes) may go undetected.  \n",
    "- ML models may be trained on silently corrupted datasets.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommendation**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Define a **schema object** (even a simple Python dict or dataclass at first) that lists expected columns, types and ranges.  \n",
    "- Add a `validate_schema(df)` step early in the pipeline, which raises clear, human-readable errors when expectations are not met.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Cleaning & Transformation Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we looked at**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Centralisation of cleaning functions (e.g. parsing, trimming, normalising text, handling missing values)  \n",
    "- Reuse of logic between EDA notebooks and ML scripts  \n",
    "- Potential sources of duplication and divergence  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Findings**\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ Cleaning logic is well structured into dedicated functions; this is a strong asset.  \n",
    "- ✅ Common transformations are reused, which reduces the risk of data inconsistencies.  \n",
    "- ⚠️ Some transformations mix:  \n",
    "  - purely technical corrections (e.g. type casting) and  \n",
    "  - **business rules** (e.g. dropping certain animals or records).  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Risk**\n",
    "\n",
    "When business rules are embedded inside low-level cleaning, it becomes harder to explain **why** records disappear or change — and to revisit decisions later.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommendation**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Refactor cleaning logic into two layers:  \n",
    "  - **Technical sanitation** (null handling, trimming, type casting, parsing)  \n",
    "  - **Business filtering and rule-based exclusions**  \n",
    "- Document business rules explicitly in docstrings and/or markdown cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Feature Engineering Layer\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we looked at**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Creation of derived features (ratios, bins, interaction terms)  \n",
    "- Reuse of engineered features between notebooks and ML scripts  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Findings**\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ Feature engineering is kept relatively light, which is appropriate for early iterations.  \n",
    "- ⚠️ As complexity grows, feature creation will need to be **centralised** (to avoid each notebook “rolling its own” features).  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommendation**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Introduce a `feature_engineering.py` module responsible for:  \n",
    "  - generating features from a cleaned base table  \n",
    "  - exposing versioned functions (e.g. `build_features_v1`, `build_features_v2`)  \n",
    "- This allows ML experimentation without breaking dependent notebooks or reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Output Management & Data Products\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we looked at**\n",
    "\n",
    "- How cleaned datasets and intermediate artefacts are saved  \n",
    "- Folder naming logic under `data/cleaned/` and `results/`  \n",
    "- Fit for purpose for EDA, ML and applications  \n",
    "\n",

    "- ⚠️ No **central index** describing which outputs exist, their intended consumer, and their refresh frequency.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommendation**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Maintain a simple **data product catalogue** (even a CSV or markdown table) listing:  \n",
    "  - dataset name  \n",
    "  - path  \n",
    "  - grain (row-level meaning)  \n",
    "  - primary consumer (EDA, ML, Streamlit, etc.)  \n",
    "  - refresh mechanism (manual, scheduled, ad-hoc)  \n",

    "\n",
    "### 6. Observability, Logging & Governance\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we looked at**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Presence of structured logs and error handling  \n",
    "- Ability to answer: *“What happened during the last pipeline run?”*  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Findings**\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ Logging utilities exist (e.g. via `logger_config`), which is an excellent foundation.  \n",
    "- ⚠️ Not all pipeline steps emit structured logs (start, end, key stats).  \n",
    "- ⚠️ No central run-level metadata (run ID, timestamp, input files, row counts).  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommendation**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Define a simple `run_pipeline()` entry point that:  \n",
    "  - records the start/end of each major step  \n",
    "  - logs key metrics: row count in/out, null rates, number of dropped records  \n",
    "  - stores a small JSON or CSV metadata file per run in `results/metadata/`  \n",

    "- Refactor cleaning into **technical vs business rules** modules.  \n",

    "\n",
    "### 3. Long-Term (3–6+ months) — “Automate & Govern”\n",
    "\n",
    "- Integrate a formal validation framework (Great Expectations / pandera / Pydantic).  \n",
    "- Add orchestrated runs (via Airflow, Prefect, Dagster, or CI pipelines).  \n",
