    "## Part A — Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Role of the ML Pipeline in the Overall Product\n",
    "\n",
    "The **ML pipeline** is the layer that transforms cleaned and engineered features into **predictive models** capable of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Estimating **animal weight** from observable features,  \n",
    "- Supporting **analytics and what‑if scenarios**,  \n",
    "- Powering downstream applications (notebooks, Streamlit app, API‑like interfaces).\n",
    "\n",
    "Its quality directly affects:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Prediction reliability,  \n",
    "- Business trust in AI‑driven recommendations,  \n",
    "- The speed at which new models can be tested and deployed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Headline Assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "The current ML pipeline represents a **solid, well‑structured prototype**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Models are trained on a **clean dataset** with clear features,  \n",
    "- Core scikit‑learn practices are followed (fit/predict, train/test split, etc.),  \n",
    "- Results are reproducible on a single‑machine / notebook basis,  \n",
    "- Artefacts (models, plots, metrics) are saved in dedicated folders under `results/`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To reach **enterprise‑grade maturity**, several aspects need to evolve:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Formalisation of data and model contracts**  \n",
    "   - No explicit contract for feature schema at training vs inference time.  \n",
    "   - Limited protection against **data drift** or schema changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Standardisation of training & evaluation flows**  \n",
    "   - Experimental logic and production logic are partially intertwined.  \n",
    "   - Cross‑validation, hyperparameter search and evaluation are not yet fully packaged.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model governance (versioning, registry, traceability)**  \n",
    "   - Trained models are saved, but without a **central registry** or rich metadata.  \n",
    "   - Harder to answer: “Which model is currently in use, and why?”\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Key Strengths\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ Clear separation between **data preparation** and **model training** (conceptually aligned).  \n",
    "- ✅ Use of **standard ML libraries** (scikit‑learn) with predictable behaviour.  \n",
    "- ✅ Directory structure in `results/` logically groups plots, stats and models.  \n",
    "- ✅ Strong foundation for turning this into a **production‑ready ML asset**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Key Risks\n",
    "\n",
    "- ⚠️ Risk of **silent interface mismatch** between training and inference (e.g. feature order, missing columns).  \n",
    "- ⚠️ No systematic **experiment tracking**, making it difficult to compare runs over time.  \n",
    "- ⚠️ Limited transparency for leadership on **model robustness and limitations**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Top 5 Strategic Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define formal **feature contracts** and enforce them at training and inference.  \n",
    "2. Standardise train/validation/test strategy with **cross‑validation** where relevant.  \n",
    "3. Introduce basic **experiment tracking** (metrics, params, model versions) – even via CSV/JSON at first.  \n",
    "4. Establish a lightweight **model registry** to track which model is “current”, “candidate”, “deprecated”.  \n",
    "5. Package inference into a **single, well‑defined pipeline** function usable by the Streamlit app or other clients.\n",

    "## Part B — Context & Modeling Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Business Context\n",
    "\n",
    "The business problem is to **predict animal weight** (a continuous target) using morphological and contextual features.  \n",
    "This supports:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Better understanding of **species‑level patterns**,  \n",
    "- Potential operational use cases (e.g. planning, resource allocation, habitat management),  \n",
    "- Downstream analytics and visualisations for stakeholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Role of the ML Pipeline in the Stack\n",
    "\n",
    "The ML pipeline sits on top of **cleaned data and EDA learnings** (documented in previous audit notebooks).  \n",
    "It:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Consumes cleaned features from `data/cleaned/`,  \n",
    "- Produces **trained models** and **evaluation metrics** into `results/model/ML/`,  \n",
    "- Exposes predictions to notebooks / app layers (directly or via saved artefacts).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Modeling Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "From an ML perspective, the objectives are to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Build models that achieve **stable predictive performance**,  \n",
    "- Avoid **overfitting**, ensuring generalisation to new observations,  \n",
    "- Provide interpretable insights where possible (feature importance, partial effects),  \n",

    "\n",
    "We reviewed the ML pipeline along three key aspects:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data & Feature Readiness**  \n",
    "   - Are inputs to the model robust, well‑defined, and consistent with EDA findings?  \n",
    "\n",

    "### 1. Data Ingestion & Feature Readiness\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we examine**\n",
    "\n",
    "- How the model training code accesses the dataset (paths, loaders, configs),  \n",
    "- Whether features used at training time are clearly defined and documented,  \n",
    "- Alignment with the cleaned dataset structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Findings**\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ Training scripts rely on **cleaned data** (e.g. `data/cleaned/clean_animal_data.csv`), which is good practice.  \n",
    "- ✅ Use of centralised path utilities (e.g. `config_utils`, `paths_utils`) reduces hard‑coding.  \n",
    "- ⚠️ Feature lists / selections may be defined **inside notebooks or scripts**, making contracts implicit.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Risks**\n",
    "\n",
    "- If columns are added, renamed, or removed upstream, model training may break or silently behave differently.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommendations**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Define an explicit **`FEATURE_SET`** (Python list or config) referenced in all training and inference code.  \n",
    "- Document which features are:  \n",
    "  - mandatory,  \n",
    "  - optional,  \n",
    "  - derived.  \n",

    "- How data is split between training, validation, and test sets,  \n",
    "- Avoidance of target leakage,  \n",
    "- Whether the evaluation set is reused across experiments.\n",

    "\n",
    "- ✅ Use of **train/test split** or similar scikit‑learn utilities is in place.  \n",
    "- ⚠️ The validation strategy may rely on a **single split**, which can be noisy for small/medium datasets.  \n",
    "- ⚠️ No clear distinction between **model selection** (validation) and **final performance estimation** (test).  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommendations**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adopt **k‑fold cross‑validation** for model selection where appropriate.  \n",
    "- Reserve a **hold‑out test set** that is used *only* for final reporting, not for tuning.  \n",

    "- Presence of training vs validation/test comparisons,  \n",
    "- Checks for overfitting and underfitting.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Always report, side by side:  \n",
    "  - training metric,  \n",
    "  - validation/test metric,  \n",
    "  - absolute and relative difference.  \n",
    "- For tree‑based models, consider a simple **error‑by‑segment** view (e.g. MAE per species).  \n",

    "### 1. Short‑Term (0–4 weeks) — “Stabilise & Make Explicit”\n",
    "\n",
    "- Define and centralise **feature lists** and input schemas.  \n",
    "- Refactor training scripts to clearly separate:  \n",
    "  - data loading,  \n",
    "  - preprocessing,  \n",
    "  - modelling,  \n",
    "  - evaluation,  \n",
    "  - saving artefacts.  \n",
    "- Start writing a minimal **model metadata file** (per run) capturing metrics and params.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Mid‑Term (1–3 months) — “Standardise & Govern”\n",
    "\n",
    "- Implement standard **cross‑validation** and hyperparameter search for key algorithms.  \n",
    "- Build a **lightweight model registry** (CSV/JSON) updated automatically.  \n",
    "- Package a **`predict()` function** that can be used consistently across notebooks and the Streamlit app.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Long‑Term (3–6+ months) — “Productise & Monitor”\n",
    "\n",
    "- Integrate the ML pipeline into **CI/CD** (e.g. GitHub Actions) for automated training on new data.  \n",
    "- Extend the registry with **deployment status**, **roll‑back capacity**, and basic drift checks.  \n",
    "- Consider introducing an experiment tracking tool once the volume of experiments increases.\n",
