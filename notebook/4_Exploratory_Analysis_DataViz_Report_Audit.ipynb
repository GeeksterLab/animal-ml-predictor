    "## Part A — Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. EDA’s Role in the Overall Data Product\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and visualization layer is where raw or cleaned data is transformed into:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Narratives** that business stakeholders can understand,  \n",
    "- **Hypotheses** that guide modelling choices,  \n",
    "- **Quality checks** that reveal data issues before they impact models or applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, the EDA notebook is the **primary diagnostic lens** on the animal morphology dataset: it shapes how stakeholders perceive data quality, variability, and modelling potential.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Headline Assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "The current EDA implementation provides a **solid technical baseline**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Key summary statistics are computed correctly,  \n",
    "- Visuals show relevant distributions and relationships,  \n",
    "- Some issues (missing values, skewness) are visible and interpretable.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, to reach **board-level impact and consulting-grade clarity**, three gaps must be addressed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Lack of a structured analytical storyline**  \n",
    "   Plots exist, but they are not yet orchestrated into a narrative that answers:  \n",
    "   > “What did we learn and what should we do?”\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Limited segmentation and business framing**  \n",
    "   The dataset is explored mostly “in aggregate” rather than via **business-relevant subgroups** (by species, category, ranges, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Visual communication not yet aligned with executive consumption**  \n",
    "   Visuals are legible but not fully optimised for non-technical stakeholders (hierarchy, annotations, colour usage, key messages).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Key Strengths\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ Correct use of baseline descriptive statistics and plots  \n",
    "- ✅ Intuitive visual forms (histograms, correlation heatmaps, scatter plots)  \n",
    "- ✅ Stable pipeline of inputs from the cleaned dataset  \n",
    "- ✅ Technically sound foundations for feature engineering and ML modelling\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Key Risks\n",
    "\n",
    "- ⚠️ Important insights risk remaining **implicit**, requiring interpretation effort from each reader  \n",
    "- ⚠️ Outliers and anomalies are visible but not systematically quantified or flagged  \n",
    "- ⚠️ The same EDA logic cannot be easily **reused** for future versions or new datasets without manual rework  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Top 5 Strategic Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Introduce a **clear analytical storyline** structured around 3–5 core business questions.  \n",
    "2. Systematically **segment** the analysis by species and other key attributes.  \n",
    "3. Standardise visual design for **executive readability** (consistent palettes, annotations, titles, and footers).  \n",
    "4. Add a lightweight **statistical alerting layer** (skewness, extreme values, missingness).  \n",
    "5. Refactor EDA logic into **reusable functions/modules**, turning this notebook into a **template** for future analyses.\n",

    "### 1. Business Context\n",
    "\n",
    "The project is focused on understanding and predicting **animal weight** based on morphological and contextual variables. Business and analytical stakeholders rely on this EDA layer to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Validate whether the data supports reliable modelling,  \n",
    "- Explore hypotheses about **how different species behave**,  \n",
    "- Identify data gaps or inconsistencies before productionising models,  \n",

    "### 2. Role of EDA in the End-to-End Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "EDA sits between:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the **data pipeline** (raw → cleaned datasets), and  \n",
    "- the **modelling pipeline** (cleaned → features → ML models),\n",
    "\n",
    "and also directly supports:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the **Streamlit application**,  \n",
    "- any analytical or strategic presentations built atop the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the EDA layer is weak, the **entire chain** (models, app, decisions) becomes fragile.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 3. Analytical Objectives for This Audit\n",
    "\n",

    "- How well does the current EDA surface **structure, patterns, and data risks**?  \n",

    "\n",
    "The EDA & visualization layer is reviewed under three angles:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Statistical Soundness**  \n",

    "- Missing value patterns and basic sanity checks (weights, heights, etc.)  \n",

    "\n",
    "- ✅ Core descriptive statistics (mean, median, std, min, max) are correctly computed.  \n",
    "- ✅ Missing values are visible at column level, enabling quick assessment.  \n",
    "- ⚠️ There is limited use of **data health KPIs** such as:  \n",
    "  - proportion of invalid / extreme values per key variable,  \n",
    "  - consistency checks (e.g. weight vs length ranges per species).  \n",

    "**Recommendation**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Introduce a concise **Data Health Summary** table with:  \n",
    "  - row count, distinct species count, missingness per variable,  \n",
    "  - simple business rules (e.g. weight > 0, reasonable upper limits).  \n",

    "### 2. Distribution Analysis\n",
    "\n",

    "**Findings**\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ Distribution plots are present and correctly configured.  \n",
    "- ✅ Skewness is visually detectable in some variables.  \n",

    "- ⚠️ The implications for modelling (e.g. need for log transform, binning) are not explicitly stated.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommendation**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compute and display **skewness and kurtosis** alongside distribution plots.  \n",
    "- Add explicit interpretations:  \n",
    "  > “Weight_kg is right-skewed; consider log-transforming for linear models.”  \n",

    "- ✅ Some pairwise relationships are explored.  \n",
    "- ⚠️ The most important relationships (from a modelling perspective) are not **ranked** or prioritised.  \n",
    "- ⚠️ Non-linear relationships are not explicitly tested (e.g. polynomial patterns, thresholds).  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommendation**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Produce a **“Top 5 strongest correlations”** summary table and add commentary.  \n",

    "### 4. Segmentation & Subgroup Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we examine**\n",

    "- Whether EDA distinguishes between key segments such as species, region, environment, or weight bands.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Findings**\n",
    "\n",
    "- ⚠️ Most analysis is performed at **global level** (all animals aggregated).  \n",
    "- ❗ This under-utilises the richness of the dataset and may obscure segment-specific insights.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommendation**\n",
    "\n",
    "- For each key question, provide both:  \n",
    "  - an **overall view** and  \n",
    "  - a **segmented view** (e.g. per species).  \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- How atypical values are surfaced and handled.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Findings**\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ Outliers are visible on boxplots and scatterplots.  \n",
    "- ⚠️ There is no **systematic thresholding** or labelling for outliers.  \n",
    "- ⚠️ No clear framing of which anomalies are **data errors** vs valid but rare cases.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommendation**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Introduce a simple **rule-based outlier flagging** (e.g. beyond 3×IQR).  \n",
    "- Summarise:  \n",
    "  - how many records are flagged as potential outliers,  \n",
    "  - decision recommendation: inspect, cap, remove, or keep as-is.  \n",

    "- Titles, subtitles, axis labels, annotations, colour usage, and ordering of plots.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Findings**\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ Visuals are readable for technical audiences.  \n",
    "- ⚠️ Titles are sometimes descriptive but not **insight-focused**.  \n",
    "- ⚠️ Few charts explicitly highlight a **takeaway sentence**.  \n",
    "- ⚠️ No consistent **visual system** (colours, fonts, spacing) that would feel “productised” or “brand-aligned”.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommendation**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adopt a simple **visual style guide** (colour palette, font sizes, annotation style).  \n",
